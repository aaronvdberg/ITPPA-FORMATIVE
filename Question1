Cafeteria Order System

You are a software developer working for a university cafeteria. The cafeteria wants to automate the process of calculating bills for customers based on the items they purchase. The program should ask the user to input their name, surname, and the number of items they have ordered, along with the price for each item. The program will then calculate the total bill, apply a discount if applicable, and write the customer's details and their total bill to a text file for record-keeping.

Menu:

    Coffee - R15.00
    Sandwich - R30.00
    Salad - R25.00
    Juice - R10.00
    Muffin - R20.00
    Pizza Slice - R35.00
    Soup - R18.00
    Burger - R40.00
