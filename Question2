Shopping Cart Program

You are tasked with developing a shopping cart system for an online store. The store has a predefined list of items that customers can purchase. The system should allow customers to select items and specify quantities, calculate the total cost, apply a discount if applicable, and write the final bill to a text file for record-keeping.

The store has a policy where a 5% discount is applied if the total cost of the items exceeds R200.

The system will prompt the user to enter their name, select items from the menu, and enter the quantities. After the total is calculated and any discount applied, the program will output the customerâ€™s final bill and save the details to a text file.

 

2.1 Design a flowchart that represents the logic of the shopping cart program described above. The flowchart should clearly show the sequence of actions, including decision points, calculations, and file handling.
